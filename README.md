# How to load appointments On-Demand in Flutter Calendar?

This example demonstrates how to load appointments On-Demand in Flutter Calendar.

By using the handleLoadMore method you can load the appointments to the Flutter Event Calendar on-demand and use the [loadMoreWidgetBuilder](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/loadMoreWidgetBuilder.html) to customise the loading indicator.

## Define Load more widget builder.
You can build your own custom widget by using the loadMoreWidgetBuilder that will be displayed as a loading indicator in the calendar when the calendar view changes.

## Loading appointments
Update the appointments on-demand, when the loading indicator is displaying in the calendar by using the [handleLoadMore](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/CalendarDataSource/handleLoadMore.html) method in the CalendarDataSource.
